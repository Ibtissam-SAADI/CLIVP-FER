# CLIVP-FER:LEVERAGING VISION LANGUAGE MODELS FOR FACIAL EXPRESSION RECOGNITION
A CLIP based pytorch implementation on facial expression recognition (KMU-FED, FER2013, and RAF-DB), achieving an average accuracy of 97.36%  in KMU-FED, an accuracy of 99.01% and 99.22% in FER2013  and RAF-DB datasets(state-of-the-art)
